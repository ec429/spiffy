Spiffy: Yet another ZX Spectrum emulator
Ideas & Future Plans

CORE:

DEBUGGER:
Rewrite debugger internals to first parse the command into tokens.
Disabled & single-shot breakpoints.
Funky breakpoints in debugger: break on memory read/write in range, port read/write in range (or matching bits), execution of RET, RETurn from current function (effectively just single-shot (SP) read trap).
Breakpoint conditions, like Tstate count, register-has-value, memory-location-has-value.  Allow conditions to be ANDed together (eg. Break on port read !A0 while Tstate between foo and bar and regB nonzero).
Make memory addresses in debugger allow an extended format that handles eg. locations in peripheral memory, computed addresses, &c.
Arguments to t[race] interpreted like m r, with the semantics of gdb 'display'

UI:
Debugger frontend harness: user-friendly debugger frontends (curses?  GUI?)
